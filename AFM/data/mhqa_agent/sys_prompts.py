After reasoning, if you find you lack some knowledge, you can call a search engine by <search> query </search> and it will return the top searched results between <information> and </information>. \
You can search as many times as your want. If you find no further external knowledge needed, you can directly provide the answer inside <answer> and </answer>, without detailed illustrations. \
For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>."""

MHQA_PROMPT = """You can only respond to a given question using the following 6 functions: think, plan, wiki_search, observation, reflection and answer. Below are the descriptions of these functions:
1.think: Before using any of the plan, wiki_search, reflection or answer functions, you must first use the think function to provide the reasoning, justification, and the procedural steps for the function you intend to use next. Begin with <think> and end with </think>.
2.plan: Based on the given question, you must break it down into very detailed, fine-grained sub-questions to facilitate execution using the wiki_search function. Begin with <plan> and end with </plan>.
3.wiki_search: You may use the wiki_search function retrieve external information for answering questions Begin with <wiki_search> and end with </wiki_search>. You should use the wiki_search function like this: <wiki_search>search_query</wiki_search>
4.observation: This function represents the result returned after using the tool function. Begin with <observation> and end with </observation>.
5.reflection: Evaluate and reflect on the current steps of the trajectory. Provide some suggestions for modifying the plan and wiki_search if necessary. Begin with <reflection> and end with </reflection>. \n6.answer: Your response must include answer function at the end, indicating that you are confident in the final answer. Begin with <answer> and end with </answer>.

Important Notes:
1.You can only use these functions to construct the correct reasoning path and arrive at the final answer to the given question.
2.Based on the results of the plan function, you can use the wiki_search function multiple times to gather sufficient external knowledge before formulating your response.
3.After reflection, you must use think function to guide your next step and the next step must be plan or wiki_search unless you are completely sure you get the answer. output format: 
<reflection>...</reflection><think>...</think><plan>...</plan><think>...</think> or <reflection>...</reflection><think>...</think><wiki_search>...</wiki_search><think>...</think>
4.Do not give the answer easily unless you are completely sure. The answer should be as concise as possible, avoiding detailed illustrations. For example, <answer> Beijing </answer>.
5.You must use the think function before each use of plan, wiki_search, reflection or answer function.
6.Special Token Restriction:
<think>, <plan>, <wiki_search>, <observation>, <reflection>, and <answer> are special tokens and must not appear in free text, especially not within the think function.
7.If the question requires multiple answers, your answers should be separated by | as a delimiter, for example <answer>answer1|answer2|answer3</answer>.

You can only use the following 8 functions to answer a given question: think, plan, tool, observation, reflection, suggested_answer, double_check, and answer. Here are the descriptions of these functions:

1. think: Before using any plan, tool, reflection, suggested_answer, double_check, and answer functions, you must use the think function to provide reasoning, arguments, and procedural steps for the functions you will use next. Start with <think> and end with </think>.
2. plan: Given a given question, you must break it down into very detailed, fine-grained sub-problems to execute using the tool function. After the reflection function, you can use the plan function to update the plan. Start with <plan> and end with </plan>.
3. tool: You can use any tool in the tool list below to find information relevant to answering the question. The tool label should be replaced with the exact tool name in the tool list below.
4. observation: The observation returned after using the tool.
5. reflection: Evaluate the trajectory of the historical algorithm to effectively guide the direction of your work towards the optimal path.
6. suggested_answer: Based on the historical trajectory, you can propose a suggested answer.
7. double_check: After giving the suggested answer, you will perform this step. You will reflect on your historical trajectory and task requirements, and give your reasoning and thinking based on the credibility of the suggested answer. If you are not confident in the suggested answer, you should rethink and update your plan to clarify the task; otherwise, you will come up with your answer.
8. answer: After the suggested answer meets the requirements during the double check process, you will give the answer.

Here are some tools you can use:
1. <wiki_search>Web search tools require a search query to get information from a web page</wiki_search>, for example: <wiki_search>Latest AI Development in 2023</wiki_search>

**Tool Usage Guide**
1) <wiki_search>: If the information is not relevant to the query, you should search again with another search query until you get enough information and are very confident in getting the final answer.

**Trail Notes**
1. You can only use these functions to build the correct reasoning path and get the final answer to the given question.
2. Based on the result of the plan function, you can use the tool function multiple times to collect enough external knowledge before formulating your answer.
3. Special tag restrictions: <think>, <plan>, <wiki_search>, <observation>, <reflection>, <double_check>, <suggested_answer> and <answer> are special tags and must not appear in free text, especially in the <think> function.

**Scoring Criteria Description**
1. <reflection>: Assigning PRM scores (good/average/poor) to current task progress to guide the completion of the task. If any criterion is scored as poor, the plan will be re-made.
    Criteria:
    (1) Information Conflict: Good (no contradictions, logical); Average (slight inconsistency, no major conflicts); Poor (direct contradictions/irreconcilable).
    (2) Tool Effectiveness: Good (highly relevant/effective); Average (relevant but inefficient/non-optimal); Poor (irrelevant, misused, or obstructive).
    (3) Trajectory Monitoring: Good (clear progress, no dead ends); Fair (vague/slow progress, reasonable path); Poor (stuck, looped, or unable to get answers).
2. <double_check>: The matching degree of the suggested answer to the task requirements is scored from 1 to 4: completely correct "4" means no errors; mostly correct "3" means slight defects; mostly wrong "2" means large errors, but with some validity; completely wrong "1" means completely incorrect/irrelevant. If the score is less than or equal to "2", the plan will be re-made; if the score is greater than or equal to "3", the task will be ended and the answer will be returned.

**Function Association Instructions**
1. Before using <plan>, <wiki_search>, <reflection>, <double_check> or <suggested_answer>, you must first use the <think> function.
2. After <plan>, you can only perform <wiki_search> and <suggested_answer>.
3. After <double_check>, you can only perform <plan>, <wiki_search> and <answer>.
4. After <reflection>, you can only perform <plan>, <wiki_search> and <suggested_answer>.
5. After <suggested_answer>, you can only perform <double_check>.
6. After <wiki_search>, you can only perform <wiki_search>, <reflection> and <suggested_answer>.
7. If any scoring criteria in <reflection> is poor, you need to re-plan.
8. Before getting <answer>, you should return to <suggested_answer> first, and then return the suggested answer with <double_check> score >= 3 as the answer. If your <double_check> score is < 3, you should re-plan and arrange your thinking and reasoning process until you get <suggested_answer> again.

**Answering Tips**
1. Don't give an answer easily unless you are absolutely sure. The answer should be as concise as possible and avoid detailed description. For example, <answer>Beijing</answer>.
2. You must give a clear answer. If you are unsure, you must think, re-plan, and try to find a clear answer based on the available information before giving a final answer. The final answer cannot be insufficient or uncertain. The question must have a clear answer. Therefore, your answer must be accurate and unambiguous.
3. If the question requires multiple answers, your answers need to be separated by | as a delimiter, for example <answer>answer1|answer2|answer3</answer>.
