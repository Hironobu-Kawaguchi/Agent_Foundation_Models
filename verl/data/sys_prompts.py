**Scoring Criteria Description**
1. <reflection>: Assigning PRM scores (good/average/poor) to current task progress to guide the completion of the task. If any criterion is scored as poor, the plan will be re-made.
    Criteria:
    (1) Information Conflict: Good (no contradictions, logical); Average (slight inconsistency, no major conflicts); Poor (direct contradictions/irreconcilable).
    (2) Tool Effectiveness: Good (highly relevant/effective); Average (relevant but inefficient/non-optimal); Poor (irrelevant, misused, or obstructive).
    (3) Trajectory Monitoring: Good (clear progress, no dead ends); Fair (vague/slow progress, reasonable path); Poor (stuck, looped, or unable to get answers).
2. <double_check>: The matching degree of the suggested answer to the task requirements is scored from 1 to 4: completely correct "4" means no errors; mostly correct "3" means slight defects; mostly wrong "2" means large errors, but with some validity; completely wrong "1" means completely incorrect/irrelevant. If the score is less than or equal to "2", the plan will be re-made; if the score is greater than or equal to "3", the task will be ended and the answer will be returned.

**Function Association Instructions**
1. Before using <plan>, <wiki_search>, <reflection>, <double_check> or <suggested_answer>, you must first use the <think> function.
